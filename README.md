# Workshop: Micro Frontends

Repository for the workshop regarding Micro Frontends at QCon San Francisco.

## Repository Structure

* **demos**: Contains all the demos referenced in the theory parts.
* **exercises**: Contains information and boilerplate code to be used for doing the exercises.
* **slides**: Contains the slides used for the day.
* **solutions**: Contains solution proposals for the different exercises.

Make sure to run `npm i` in each folder containing a *package.json*.

Some demos / examples / solutions have a *run-all.sh* file. This works in WSL, Linux, and MacOS. Running the script via `./run-all.sh` will actually install and run everything necessary for the respective demo / example / solution. For PowerShell users (Windows) you'll also a find a `./run-all.ps1` in the same directory. When using those scripts there is no need to run `npm i` explicitly.
