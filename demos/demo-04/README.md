# Module Federation

The tractor example converted to use SPA composition powered by Webpack Module Federation.

## Advantages

* Allows combination of multiple independent applications into a single application
* Everything is strongly coupled and therefore easy to understand

## Disadvantages

* Tooling restricted to Webpack (PoCs for some other bundlers exist, but they are not yet feature complete or fully stable)
* Loose coupling is an afterthought

## Area of Use

* Combining Webpack-powered applications into a single application
