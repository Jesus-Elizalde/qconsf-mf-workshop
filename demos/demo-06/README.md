# Central Dependency Sharing

This demo shows how importmaps can be used to share resources between ESMs. Right now, native importmaps are only supported in Chrome. Additionally, the support in Chrome is restricted to inline importmaps.

For enhanced support check out [SystemJS](https://github.com/systemjs/systemjs).

## Advantages

* Web standard
* Very fine-grained control, very clear

## Disadvantages

* Increased maintenance effort on the app shell team
* Natively only works in Chrome - and only inline

## Area of Use

* In my opinion not production ready yet - for a production use case see [demo 4](../demo-04/README.md)
